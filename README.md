Hi! This is my first GitHub repository and first time connecting R-Studio to Github. In this project, I do a brief data analysis of the Kaggle datasets on the Eurovision Song Contest. For more on the contest itself, and to view the created plots/their descriptions, please see the esc_epa pdf in files. The files with the most relevant information are esc_scatter_plots.R (part 1 of the pdf), esc_bar_plots.R (part 2 of the pdf), and song_data.csv (the csv used from Kaggle)
> For suggestions on improvement (such as chart visibility, overlooked data, or code readability) please reach out to me via LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/alice-mardanian/
